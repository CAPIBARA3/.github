# Hi there üëã, we are CAPIBARA!

CAPIBARA $^1$ is a student-driven collaboration dedicated to launching a satellite for the exploration of the high-energy cosmos, including both ionic (particle-based) and photonic (light-based: X-ray and $\gamma$-ray) radiation and bursts. To help us achieve this ambitious goal, we have applied to the SPARK program by the Spanish company PLD Space, which offers a platform to support innovative space projects.

We believe our initiative holds significant value for the astronomical community and other scientific fields, paving the way for groundbreaking research and discoveries.

Explore more about our project on our [website](https://capibara3.github.io). There, you will find:
- A general description of our mission and goals,
- Our detailed proposal document,
- Insights into our internal research initiatives (we‚Äôd love to hear how you would use this data!),
- Plans for our instruments,
- And an introduction to the collaboration members.

We are a group of high school students from the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, united by our ambition to participate in this singular project. Our interests span from theoretical astrophysics to aerospace engineering, and we are eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the understanding of the energetic cosmos and our place in it

We encourage you to contact us at our [email](mailto:capibara-mission@outlook.com). Join us on this exciting journey‚Äîwe are thrilled to have you onboard! üöÄ
